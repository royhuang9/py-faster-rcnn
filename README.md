### Summary

This is py-faster-rcnn forked from [rbgirshick's work](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn). 

This repo shows an example of adding new dataset and train an object detector for your own dataset.

For the details, please refer to my post, [Detection: Faster  R-CNN](https://huangying-zhan.github.io/2016/09/22/detection-faster-rcnn.html).
